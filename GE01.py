## Lists
numbers = []
strings = []
names = ["John", "Eric", "Jessica"]

# write your code here
second_name = names[1]
numbers.append(1)

# this code should write out the filled arrays and the second name in the names list (Eric).

## Basic Operators
x = object()
y = object()

# TODO: change this code

print("y_list contains %d objects" % len(y_list))
print("big_list contains %d objects" % len(big_list))

# testing code
if x_list.count(x) == 10 and y_list.count(y) == 10:
    print("Almost there...")
if big_list.count(x) == 10 and big_list.count(y) == 10:
